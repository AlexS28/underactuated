      <h1>Fully-actuated vs Underactuated Systems</h1>
      
      <p>Robots today move far too conservatively, and accomplish only a
        fraction of the tasks and achieve a fraction of the performance that
        they are mechanically capable of.  In many cases, we are still
        fundamentally limited by control technology which matured on rigid
        robotic arms in structured factory environments.  The study of
        underactuated robotics focuses on building control systems which use
        the natural dynamics of the machines in an attempt to achieve
        extraordinary performance in terms of speed, efficiency, or
        robustness.</p>

          <h1>Honda's ASIMO vs. Passive Dynamic Walkers</h1>
         
          <p>
            The world of robotics changed when, in late 1996, Honda Motor
            Co. announced that they had been working for nearly 15 years (behind
            closed doors) on walking robot technology.  Their designs have
            continued to evolve over the last 12 years, resulting in a humanoid
            robot they call ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative MObility).  Honda's
            ASIMO is widely considered to be state of the art in walking
            robots, although there are now many robots with designs and
            performance very similar to ASIMO's.  We will dedicate effort to
            understanding a few of the details of ASIMO when we discuss algorithms for walking... for now I just want you to become familiar
            with the look and feel of ASIMO's movements [watch the asimo video
            below now].

          <p>
          I hope that your first reaction is to be incredibly impressed with the
          quality and versatility of ASIMO's movements.  Now take a second look.
          Although the motions are very smooth, there is something a little
          unnatural about ASIMO's gait.  It feels a little like an astronaut
          encumbered by a heavy space suit.  In fact this is a reasonable
          analogy... ASIMO is walking a bit like somebody that is unfamiliar with
          his/her dynamics.  It's control system is using high-gain feedback,
          and therefore considerable joint torque, to cancel out the natural
          dynamics of the machine and strictly follow a desired trajectory.
          This control approach comes with a stiff penalty.  ASIMO uses roughly
          20 times the energy (scaled) that a human uses to walk on the flat
          (measured by cost of transport)<elib>Collins05</elib>.  Also, control
          stabilization in this approach only works in a relatively small
          portion of the state space (when the stance foot is flat on the
          ground), so ASIMO can't move nearly as quickly as a human, and cannot
          walk on unmodelled or uneven terrain.

<p>
For contrast, let's now consider a very different type of walking
robot, called a passive dynamic walker (PDW).  This "robot" has no motors,
no controllers, no computer, but is still capable of walking stably
down a small ramp, powered only by gravity [watch videos above now].  Most people will agree that the
passive gait of this machine is more natural than ASIMO's; it is
certainly more efficient.  Passive walking machines have a long
history - there are patents for passively walking toys dating back to
the mid 1800's.  We will discuss, in detail, what people know about
the dynamics of these machines and what has been accomplished
experimentally.  This most impressive passive dynamic walker to date
was built by Steve Collins in Andy Ruina's lab at Cornell<elib>Collins01</elib>.
</p>
          
<p>
Passive walkers demonstrate that the high-gain, dynamics-cancelling
feedback approach taken on ASIMO is not a necessary one.  In fact, the
dynamics of walking is beautiful, and should be exploited - not
cancelled out.

  <h1>Birds vs. modern aircraft</h1>

<p>
The story is surprisingly similar in a very different type of machine.
Modern airplanes are extremely effective for steady-level flight in
still air.  Propellers produce thrust very efficiently, and today's
cambered airfoils are highly optimized for speed and/or efficiency.
It would be easy to convince yourself that we have nothing left to
learn from birds.  But, like ASIMO, these machines are mostly confined
to a very conservative, low angle-of-attack flight regime where the
aerodynamics on the wing are well understood.  Birds routinely execute
maneuvers outside of this flight envelope (for instance, when they are
landing on a perch), and are considerably more effective than our best
aircraft at exploiting energy (eg, wind) in the air.  </p>

<p>
As a consequence, birds are extremely efficient flying machines; some
are capable of migrating thousands of kilometers with incredibly small
fuel supplies.  The wandering albatross can fly for hours, or even
days, without flapping its wings - these birds exploit the shear layer
formed by the wind over the ocean surface in a technique called
dynamic soaring.  Remarkably, the metabolic cost of flying for these
birds is indistinguishable from the baseline metabolic
cost<elib>Arnould96</elib>, suggesting that they can travel incredible
distances (upwind or downwind) powered almost completely by gradients
in the wind.  Other birds achieve efficiency through similarly rich
interactions with the air - including formation flying, thermal
soaring, and ridge soaring.  Small birds and large insects, such as
butterflies and locusts, use `gust soaring' to migrate hundreds or
even thousands of kilometers carried primarily by the wind.
</p>
  
<p>
Birds are also incredibly maneuverable.  The roll rate of a highly
acrobatic aircraft (e.g, the A-4 Skyhawk) is approximately 720
deg/sec<elib>Shyy08</elib>; a barn swallow has a roll rate in excess of 5000
  deg/sec<elib>Shyy08</elib>. Bats can be flying at full-speed in one
direction, and completely reverse direction while maintaining forward
speed, all in just over 2 wing-beats and in a distance less than half
the wingspan<elib>Tian06</elib>.  Although quantitative flow visualization
data from maneuvering flight is scarce, a dominant theory is that the
ability of these animals to produce sudden, large forces for
maneuverability can be attributed to unsteady aerodynamics, e.g., the
animal creates a large suction vortex to rapidly change
direction<elib>Triantafyllou95</elib>.  These astonishing capabilities are
called upon routinely in maneuvers like flared perching,
prey-catching, and high speed flying through forests and caves.  Even
at high speeds and high turn rates, these animals are capable of
incredible agility - bats sometimes capture prey on their wings,
Peregrine falcons can pull 25 G's out of a 240 mph dive to catch a
sparrow in mid-flight<elib>Tucker98</elib>, and even the small birds outside
our building can be seen diving through a chain-link fence to grab a
bite of food. 
</p>
  
<p>  
Although many impressive statistics about avian flight have been
recorded, our understanding is partially limited by experimental
accessibility - it's is quite difficult to carefully measure birds (and
the surrounding airflow) during their most impressive maneuvers
without disturbing them.  The dynamics of a swimming fish are closely
related, and can be more convenient to study.  Dolphins have been
known to swim gracefully through the waves alongside ships moving at
20 knots<elib>Triantafyllou95</elib>.  Smaller fish, such as the bluegill
sunfish, are known to possess an escape response in which they propel
themselves to full speed from rest in less than a body length; flow
visualizations indeed confirm that this is accomplished by creating a
large suction vortex along the side of the body\elib{Tytell08} -
similar to how bats change direction in less than a body length.
There are even observations of a dead fish swimming upstream
by pulling energy out of the wake of a cylinder; this passive
propulsion is presumably part of the technique used by rainbow trout
to swim upstream at mating season<elib>Beal06</elib>.

<h1>The common theme</h1>

<p>
Classical control techniques for robotics are based on the idea that
feedback can be used to override the dynamics of our machines.  These
examples suggest that to achieve outstanding dynamic performance
(efficiency, agility, and robustness) from our robots, we need to
understand how to design control system which take advantage of the
dynamics, not cancel them out.  That is the topic of this course.
</p>
  
<p>  
Surprisingly, there are relatively few formal control ideas that
consider ``exploiting" the dynamics.  In order to convince a control
theorist to consider the dynamics (efficiency arguments are not
enough), you have to do something drastic, like taking away his
control authority - remove a motor, or enforce a torque-limit.  These
issues have created a formal class of systems, the underactuated
systems, for which people have begun to more carefully consider the
dynamics of their machines in the context of control.

        <p>
          According to Newton, the dynamics of mechanical systems are second
          order ($F = ma$).  Their state is given by a vector of positions,
          $\bq$, and a vector of velocities, $\dot{\bq}$, and (possibly) time.
          The general form for a second-order controllable dynamical system is:
          $$\ddot{\bq} = {\bf f}(\bq,\dot{\bq},\bu,t),$$ where $\bu$ is the
          control vector.  As we will see, the dynamics for many of the
          robots that we care about turn out to be affine in commanded torque,
          so let's consider a slightly constrained form:
          \begin{equation}\ddot{\bq} = {\bf f}_1(\bq,\dot{\bq},t) + {\bf
          f}_2(\bq,\dot{\bq},t)\bu \label{eq:f1_plus_f2}.\end{equation}
